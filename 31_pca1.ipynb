        "1. If a Y variable exists and is part of your data, then separate your data into Y and X, as defined above — we’ll mostly be working with X. (Note: if there exists no column for Y, that’s okay — skip to the next point!)\n",

Given the columns of X, are features with higher variance more important than features with lower variance, or is the importance of features independent of the variance? (In this case, importance means how well that feature predicts Y.) If the importance of features is independent of the variance of the features, then divide each observation in a column by that column’s standard deviation.

This is quite easily done in most computing packages— in fact, the eigendecomposition of ZᵀZ is where we decompose ZᵀZ into PDP⁻¹, where P is the matrix of eigenvectors and D is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on the diagonal and values of zero everywhere else. The eigenvalues on the diagonal of D will be associated with the corresponding column in P — that is, the first element of D is λ₁ and the corresponding eigenvector is the first column of P. This holds for all elements in D and their corresponding eigenvectors in P. We will always be able to calculate PDP⁻¹ in this fashion. (Bonus: for those interested, we can always calculate PDP⁻¹ in this fashion because ZᵀZ is a symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix.)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Take the eigenvalues λ₁, λ₂, …, λp and sort them from largest to smallest. In doing so, sort the eigenvectors in P accordingly. (For example, if λ₂ is the largest eigenvalue, then take the second column of P and place it in the first column position.) Depending on the computing package, this may be done automatically. Call this sorted matrix of eigenvectors P*. (The columns of P* should be the same as the columns of P, but perhaps in a different order.) Note that these eigenvectors are independent of one another.\n",

        "7. Calculate Z* = ZP*. This new matrix, Z*, is a centered/standardized version of X but now each observation is a combination of the original variables, where the weights are determined by the eigenvector. As a bonus, because our eigenvectors in P* are independent of one another, each column of Z* is also independent of one another!"

Calculate the proportion of variance explained for each feature, sort features by proportion of variance explained and plot the cumulative proportion of variance explained as you keep more features. (This plot is called a scree plot, shown below.) One can pick how many features to include by identifying the point where adding a new feature has a significant drop in variance explained relative to the previous feature, and choosing features up until that point.
